# Markdown service
## Introduction
this is a simple implementaion of a markdown service which i am planning to use for new projects.
it supports both flexmark and commonmark although flexmark is currently reccommended as it is the most capable(i think)
and better tested. this also has unit tests to test the major functionality.

## Inspiration
Heavly inspired(almost based on) [vertx-markdown-service](https://github.com/aesteve/vertx-markdown-service) by **aesteve**
